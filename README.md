# OfflinePWA

Code built during live stream by [SchwartyDev](https://twitch.tv/schwartydev) 
on Twitch to get started with a PWA app in an Angular CLI workspace 
and to work with local storage for adding/saving data while offline.

Big shout out and thanks to [Nick Aghazarian](https://twitter.com/bluesotar)
for the request on how to do this that inspired the stream session and the code. ðŸ˜Ž
